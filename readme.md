## Introduction

**MFResManager** is a compact iOS Utility Library providing an alternate way to access ressources in an application.

This application demonstrates some feature.
It's a tabbed app with three screens :

###MFResGetter Tester View

This screen demonstrate the usage of the basic MFResGetter class.

It simply tries to load some images in the bundle and display them.

###MFKeyResGetter Tester View

This screen demonstrate the usage of the MFKeyResGetter class.

- It loads some images and localized texts by accessing the table of content file ( toc.plist )
- It loads localized interface texts via a dedicated instance of MFKeyResGetter

*Note that images can be localized as well, the same way texts are. This is not demonstrated in this sample*

Change the settings to see the various behaviors.

###Access the logs

Launch iTunes, select your device and go down the apps section.

In the AppSharing section, select 'MFResGetter Tester'. The log files are here

![ScreenShot1](https://www.moosefactory.eu/resources/MFResGetterTester_Screenshots/iTunesSharing.png)

MFResGetter.log     : Misc errors, NULL urls, file not foundsâ€¦
Missing Keys.log    : Query with missing keys in the table of content
MissingImages.log   : Missing images

This let you run an app session, and collect all media access issues much faster.

*Note that this framework will still evolve - For example, a missing image should be only logged once.. Look forward to upcoming versions.*
